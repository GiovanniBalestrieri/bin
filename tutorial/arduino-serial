#Copy it to your libraries folder. Mine was in /root/sketchbook/libraries

sudo su
cp -R /home/userk/Development/Ros/catkin_ws/src/ros_lib/ .

# Now open the example sketch  called hello world
!!!  Add the following line at the end of the sketch

		#define USE_CON

# Then launche the roscore and run the rosserial client that forwards your 
# Arduino messages to the rest of ROS. Make sure to use the correct serial 
# port: (check # the arduino IDE for the info)
